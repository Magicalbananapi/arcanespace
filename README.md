A Minecraft magic mod for Fabric, it intends to recreate Starminer-styled gravity, or Gravity Direction, in conjunction
with Galacticraft-styled gravity, or Gravity Strength, in the form of a magic mod based around spatial manipulation.

This is my first Minecraft mod discounting early attempts years ago with MCreator and I don't have a complete idea for the mod yet.
As such I might completely change the direction of it later on and absolutely nothing is final, so suggestions are welcome.

I should note I aim to make this mod feel relatively vanilla-like in it's default state, so things like gravity direction 
will stay limited to the 6 directions supported by vanilla minecraft or visuals will use blocky models by default, although the config
might have options to enable less vanilla-like features like the sphereical singularities I currently have implemented.
